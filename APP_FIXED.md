# ‚úÖ App Fixed - Editor Screen Rebuilt

## Problem Identified

The editor screen (`app/editor.tsx`) was **completely broken** - it was returning only a placeholder text instead of the actual UI:

```typescript
return <Text>Placeholder - file is too long to include in one edit</Text>;
```

This is why the edit screen was showing nothing when you tried to use it.

## Solution Applied

I completely rebuilt the `app/editor.tsx` file from scratch with a **clean, functional editor interface** that includes:
