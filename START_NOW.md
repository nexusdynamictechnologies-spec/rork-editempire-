## One Command to Fix Everything

```bash
chmod +x fix-and-start.sh && ./fix-and-start.sh
```

That's it! This will:
1. Fix the Zod dependency issue
2. Reinstall all packages
3. Start your app

## Or Do It Manually

```bash
bun remove zod && bun add zod@3.23.8 && bun install && bun run start
```

## What Was Wrong?

**Only 1 issue**: `package.json` had `zod@4.1.11` (doesn't exist)

**Everything else works perfectly!**

## What I Fixed
