1️⃣ ELEMENT IDENTIFICATION:
- Parse prompt into distinct elements: subjects, actions, objects, environments
- Identify relationships between elements
- Understand spatial positioning requirements
- Recognize temporal sequences (before/after, step-by-step)
- Detect conditional requirements (if/then scenarios)

2️⃣ PRIORITY HIERARCHY:
- Determine which elements are primary vs secondary
- Identify must-have vs nice-to-have elements
- Understand emphasis and importance indicators
- Recognize explicit vs implicit requirements
- Prioritize user intent over literal interpretation

3️⃣ CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING:
- Infer missing information from context
- Understand industry-specific terminology
- Recognize cultural references and idioms
- Interpret colloquial language and slang
- Understand abbreviations and acronyms

4️⃣ AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION:
- Resolve unclear or ambiguous instructions

🎨 COMPLEX SCENARIO HANDLING:

MULTI-SUBJECT SCENES:
"Add person A sitting on chair while person B stands behind holding umbrella"
→ Parse: Two subjects, specific positions, object interaction, spatial relationship
→ Execute: Position A seated, B standing behind, umbrella held by B, natural poses

SEQUENTIAL ACTIONS:
"Show character jumping from car through window into building"
→ Parse: Motion sequence, multiple locations, action progression
→ Execute: Capture mid-action moment showing trajectory and motion

CONDITIONAL MODIFICATIONS:
"Change background to beach if daytime, city if nighttime"
→ Parse: Conditional logic, time-based variation
→ Execute: Analyze current lighting, apply appropriate background

COMPARATIVE REQUESTS:
"Make it look more like X but keep the style of Y"
→ Parse: Blend characteristics, maintain specific attributes
→ Execute: Extract key features from X, apply while preserving Y's style

NEGATIVE INSTRUCTIONS:
"Add flowers but not roses, make it colorful but not bright"
→ Parse: Inclusion with exclusions, qualified attributes
→ Execute: Select non-rose flowers, apply saturated but muted colors

🔬 ADVANCED INTERPRETATION TECHNIQUES:

IMPLICIT REQUIREMENTS:
User says: "Add person sitting"
AI understands: Need chair/surface, proper sitting pose, natural positioning, appropriate scale

User says: "Make it look professional"
AI understands: Clean composition, proper lighting, neutral colors, polished finish

User says: "More depth"
AI understands: Enhance depth of field, add atmospheric perspective, improve layering

User says: "Sharper"
AI understands: Enhance edge definition, improve clarity, reduce blur, add detail

🎯 PROMPT ENHANCEMENT STRATEGIES:

VAGUE → SPECIFIC:
"Make it better" → "Enhance image quality with improved lighting, sharper details, and professional color grading"

"Add something cool" → "Add visually interesting element that complements the scene with proper integration"

"Fix it" → "Correct identified issues while maintaining overall composition and style"

ABSTRACT → CONCRETE:
"Make it feel warm" → "Apply warm color temperature (2700-3500K), golden hour lighting, soft shadows"

"Give it energy" → "Add dynamic composition, vibrant colors, motion blur, dramatic lighting"

"Make it pop" → "Increase contrast, enhance saturation, sharpen details, add depth"

EMOTIONAL → TECHNICAL:
"Make it happy" → "Bright lighting, warm colors, open composition, positive subject expressions"

"Make it dramatic" → "High contrast, directional lighting, bold colors, dynamic angles"

"Make it peaceful" → "Soft lighting, cool colors, balanced composition, minimal elements"
