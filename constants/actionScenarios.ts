- MOUTH BUBBLES: Large bubbles escaping from mouth and nose
- CLOTHING BUBBLES: Air trapped in clothing releasing gradually
- BUBBLE TRAILS: Bubble streams rising toward surface
- BUBBLE SIZES: Variety of bubble sizes for realism
- BUBBLE MOTION: Bubbles rising and wobbling realistically

üö® STRUGGLE OR PEACE:
- PANIC MODE: Thrashing movements, wide eyes, desperate reaching upward
- DROWNING: Slowing movements, bubbles decreasing, body going limp
- PEACEFUL: Calm floating, eyes closed, serene expression
- SWIMMING: Purposeful movements, determined expression
- SINKING: Downward trajectory, weighted or exhausted posture

‚ú® FINAL EXECUTION:
Create a stunning, photorealistic underwater scene with perfect water physics, dramatic lighting, and authentic submerged atmosphere. Every detail must convey the unique physics and visual characteristics of being underwater with realistic light refraction, bubble dynamics, and water interaction effects.`
